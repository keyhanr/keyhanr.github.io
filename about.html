						<h2>Past</h2>
						<p>I was born at the ripe age of 0, just in time to grow up in the digital age. My first interests were toy cars and ice cream, but soon I had the luxury of access to the World Wide Web. There I would spend time on Neopets or delving deep into the pits of Wikipedia. Outside of the computer I found an interest in collecting coins and stamps. 
						In elementary school I joined the flag football team, and in high school I joined the yearbook commitee and enlisted as a photographer for The Spyglass, the school newspaper.</p>

						<h2>Present</h2>
						<p>I am now in my third year at University of Toronto, specializing in computer science with a focus in AI. 
						<br>I enjoy movies that can make me really feel, and music that makes me realize we're on a rock falling through space. I enjoy casual sports with my friends, from half-court basketball to just tossing a football around. I'm lucky enough to live somewhere that I can enjoy nature and still be close to the city. I do <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/64414685@N04/">some photography</a> since I feel it would be a waste to not capture pretty moments.</p>

						<h2>Future</h2>
						<p>Realistically, I hope to work on projects that will improve the world. I think we have a long way to go before we can consider even our current systems optimized. With the computational power availible to us I think it's a waste if we don't use it fully to streamline every aspect of life.
						<br>My deepest dream is to develop an AI that can do just that, analyze the way human infrastructure is designed and give suggestions to improve it.</p>
