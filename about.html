						<h2>Past</h2>
						<p>I was born at the ripe age of 0, just in time to grow up with the digital age. I'd spend time on Neopets or delving deep into the pits of Wikipedia. I also found an interest in collecting coins, stamps, and old books. 
						Later in elementary school I joined the flag football team, and in high school I joined the yearbook commitee and enlisted as a photographer for The Spyglass, our school newspaper.</p>

						<h2>Present</h2>
						<p>I'm now graduating from University of Toronto with a degree incomputer science and cognitive science. 
						<br>I most enjoy movies and music that make me really feel. I enjoy casual sports with my friends, from half-court basketball to just tossing a football around. I'm lucky enough to live somewhere that I can enjoy nature and still be close to the city. I do <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/64414685@N04/">some photography</a> since I like to preserve feelings.</p>

						<h2>Future</h2>
						<p>I hope to work on projects that improve the world. With the computational power availible to us I think it'd be wasteful if we didn't use it fully to streamline aspects of life.
						<br>My deepest dream is to develop an AI that can do just that, analyze the way human infrastructure is designed and give suggestions to improve it.</p>
